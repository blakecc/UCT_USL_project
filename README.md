# Description

This assignment is a submission as part of the requirements for the Unsupervised Learning course in the MSc Data Science at the University of Cape Town.

There were two sections that each looked at different data sets to find structure in the data, using mostly different methods for each data set:

##  Leukemia data

The data set contains gene expression levels. Techniques employed included PCA and clustering.

## New vehicle data

The data set included vehicle models with detailed attributes. Techniques employed included PCA, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and self-organising maps.
